                                                                                                                                                                         I was born on July 26, 1992. I graduated from *BNTU* in 2014. I am a power engineer by education. But recently I got interested in programming. I was especially interested in front-end development. To better understand this topic, I read the book by John Duckett "Javascript and jquery", and also actively studied the materials on the [site](https://learn.javascript.ru/) and practiced on the [site](https://www.codewars.com/).
                                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                        I don't have much development experience at the moment. But I try to study carefully, delve into all the subtleties of programming and development. I believe that I will achieve my goals through my dedication and hard work. To improve my level of knowledge, I completed a course from WayUp! In addition to learning Javascript, I attend English courses at International House. At the moment my level of English is *A*2, but I am aiming to raise it to *B1*.
